# ft_str_is_lowercase


This repository contains the `ft_str_is_lowercase` function, a simple utility for verifying that a string is composed solely of lowercase letters. It's an essential tool for string validation, ensuring that input or data adheres to expected formatting requirements, especially when processing text-sensitive information.

## Description

The `ft_str_is_lowercase` function takes a single argument, a pointer to a string, and checks each character to determine if it is a lowercase letter (`'a'` to `'z'`). The function returns `1` (true) if the string is entirely lowercase, and `0` (false) if it finds any character that is not a lowercase letter.
